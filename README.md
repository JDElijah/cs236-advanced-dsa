# CS 236 - Advanced Data Structures  & Algorithms

Assignments and projects built with **Visual Studio 2022** and **CMake**.

## Layout
- 'assignments/' - one folder per assignment (each is its own CMake executable)
- 'src/' and 'include/' - shared code (if needed)
- 'CMakeLists.txt' - defines targets
